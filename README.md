# Crime_regression

The purpose of this report is to understand the key determinants of crime in order to generate effective, actionable policy recommendations for political candidates running for election in the state of North Carolina (modified data provided). To achieve this goal, we will examine a cross-sectional dataset of crime rate in various counties of North Carolina in the year 1987. We provide three carefully interpreted linear regression models to explore the predictive power of the independent variables in this dataset with respect to our dependent variable crime rate, focusing on how potential relationships may be utilized for better control and detection of crime. This work will focus on addressing the overarching research question: What are the major deterrents and motivators of crime, and how does the existence of factors from both categories influence overall crime rate?

Specifically, we will look to three subquestions to help narrow down our focus:

1. How does fear of arrest and convictions deter crime across North Carolina? 
2. How does wage for all types of employees influence overall crime rate? 
3. What variables are strong predictors of crime, and at the same time are robust across the entire state, irrespective of location and population density? 

We will provide rational for variable and model selection using both background information and automated methods. The development, evaluation, and interpretation of our models were divided in three stages, which can be found in sections Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3. Finally, the policy recommendations derived from this process are presented in the Policy Recommendations and Concluding Remarks section.
